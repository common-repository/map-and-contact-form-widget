== Other Notes ==
ontact form will help readers and customers contact you through your website. Most people would agree that it looks more professional to use a contact form on your website than to simply state your contact email address. It is also more practical.

Displaying an email address forces the visitor to open up their email application or login to their email service in a new browser tab. The visitor therefore has to leave your website in order to contact you; which is not ideal. A contact form is better for website owners too as it stops your email address being harvested by spammers.

When it comes to choosing a contact form solution, WordPress users are spoiled. There are many fantastic free and premium contact forum plugins available.

There has been a lot of emphasis on making responsive websites so that they are able to cater to the mobile users. However, the rising popularity of the mobile apps makes it mandatory for the websites to be available as mobile apps too.

Jumping into the mobile app fray will not do much good. The options need to be weighed and strategies need to be made so that your WordPress website’s venture into the mobile app arena is calculated and strategized for least chance of failure. Let’s look for the best options to have your WP website turned into an app.

Why mobile app when you have a responsive website The statistics clearly suggest that mobile websites account for a meager 8% of the traffic as compared to 47% of the mobile apps. Moreover, out of total time spent by the users on the mobile phones, 89% is on the apps and just 11% is on the mobile browsers. These figures suggest that mobile app is the way to go for all the services provided on the internet and WordPress websites are no exceptions.

Furthermore, mobile apps are easy to access and trigger than the mobile websites that need a browser to be accessed. With local caching features, the apps can also store some content for you that you can go through even when the internet is not functioning. A user needs to just install an app once and forget it unlike mobile web apps that need to be opened on the browser every time, it has to be accessed. Mobile apps are thus fast and more responsive, thereby enhancing the user experience a few notches higher.

Benefits that can be reaped exclusively with mobile apps Mobile apps reside inside the device and can access internal features, thus enhancing the user experience. Local caching of the content offered by the apps enables offline access to some extent. Mobile apps can send push notifications to the users, thereby personalizing their experience. Another way of utilizing your app is offering in-app purchases of premium content or products. Creating a mobile app for your WordPress website takes things to a different level and you are able to establish your brand in a more compelling way. Your content will not only become more immersive and outreached but also more accessible and shareable. If we look at the bigger picture, the fight is not between a mobile website and the mobile app. Both can co-exist and serve their own purposes by targeting the intended users.

Which Mobile app platforms to target A very important question that you need to ask before starting to develop the app is the mobile platforms to target. If we look at the market share of the different mobile operating system, the most popular one is Android followed by iOS, Windows, and Blackberry. Android accounts for 51.7% mobile market; therefore, it is quite natural that you get an Android app developed first.

It is the most operating system where all the tools and techniques come absolutely free. Analytics software can also help you in this regard. If your website shows the traffic coming from iPhones and iPads, you can consider building a mobile app for iOS platform as well.
